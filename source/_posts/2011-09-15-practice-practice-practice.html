	<p>In the pursuit of becoming a better programmer, I have come across lot of good things, which in fact have a lot of positive impact on my thinking, attitude and the way I approach a problem. &nbsp;One of such thing is the book “<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">Passionate Programmer</a>” which I am currently reading. It is all about creating a remarkable career in software development. If you are a developer, it is a highly recommended book. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>There are a lot of impressive tips we can learn from this book of wisdom. One of Such tip is “Practice, Practice, and Practice!!” It talks about how to practice as a software developer. Though it seems like a mighty task, the author “Chad Fowler” convey this by breaking the might task into the following three category (Divide and Conquer Approach).</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Physical/Coordination</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn and master the unexplored areas of the language that you are working with. Say for example, Regular Expressions</li>
			<li>Dig your language’s API and don’t reinvent the wheel</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Sight Reading</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn by reading the code </li>
			<li>Pick any of your favorite open source, explore it understand and learn the tips and tricks of the trade</li>
			<li>Add some new feature</li>
			<li>Be sure to vary the software you work with</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Improvisation</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Takes some structure or constraint and creating something new, on the fly on top of that structure. For example pick a simple program and try to write it with the self-imposed constraints</li>
			<li>Play with <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">Code Katas</a></li>
		</ul>
	</dd> 
</dl>

<h4>It’s time for action</h4>

<p>I believe these three very fundamental aspects makes a lot of difference. So, I’ve decided to get my hands dirty with these three things and here is my list of to dos.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Physical/Coordination – (I pick C# as its my primary language in my current role)</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Regular Expressions</li>
			<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
			<li>Multithreading</li>
			<li>Parallel Programming</li>
			<li>LINQ</li>
			<li>Reflection</li>
			<li>Streams and Networking</li>
			<li>Entity Framework</li>
			<li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
			<li>Customizing MVC3 Framework</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Sight Reading</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Exploring ASP.NET MVC3 source code</li>
			<li>Exploring Nunit source Code</li>
			<li>Blog my understanding during this exploration</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>Improvisation</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
			<li>Make most of Code Katas</li>
			<li>Active participation in Technical Forums</li>
		</ul>
