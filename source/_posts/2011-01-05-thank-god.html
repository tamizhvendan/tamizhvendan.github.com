    <div>
        <p>I do google whenever had difficulties while coding (Typical style of Programming
        isn’t it ???)</p>
        <p>During those never ending google searches I usually land up in the blog posts which
        salvage my difficulties.</p>
        
        <p>I wonder what would be the life of programmers if there is no such blogs exists!!</p>
        
        <p>Fine.. I don’t wanna write an essay describing my first blog. In simple words, I
        just wanted to put all my knowledge gained under single roof and share with the
        developers across the globe.</p>
        So,<br />
        Here We Go !!<br />
        <br />
        {% codeblock lang:csharp %}

namespace Earth.Developers
{
    class Tamizhvendan
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Hearty Thanks to all blog writers " + 
                                        "across the globe who inspired me to write this blog !!");
        }
    }
}
        
        {% endcodeblock %}
    </div>
