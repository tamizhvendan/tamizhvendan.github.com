<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><strong>Thank God!!</strong><br />I do google whenever had difficulties while coding (Typical style of Programming isn’t it ???).<br />During those never ending google searches I usually land up in the blog posts which salvage my difficulties.<br />I wonder what would be the life of programmers if there is no such blogs exists!! <br />Fine.. I don’t wanna write an essay describing my first blog. In simple words, I just wanted to put all my knowledge gained under single roof and share with the developers across the globe.<br />So,<br />Here We Go !!<br /><br /><pre class="csharp" name="code">namespace Earth.Developers<br />{<br />  class Tamizhvendan<br />  {<br />    public static void Main(string[] args)<br />     {<br />          System.Console.WriteLine("Hearty Thanks to all blog writers    across the globe who inspired me to write this blog !!");<br />     }<br />  }<br />}<br /><br /></pre></div></div>
