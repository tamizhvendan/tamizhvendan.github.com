> This is step 2 of my blog series on [Web Application Development in Fsharp using ASP.NET MVC]({% post_url 2014-12-10-web-application-development-in-fsharp-using-asp-dot-net-mvc %})

In the [last blog post]({% post_url 2014-12-17-phonecat-backend-using-web-api-and-typeproviders %}) we have created web-api endpoints which serve the data for the home page and in this blog post we are going to create views of the phones and manufacturers using [Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Razor_view_engine).
