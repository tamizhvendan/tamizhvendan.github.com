<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div align="justify"><br /></div><div align="justify">2011 has been a magnificent year for me both professionally and personally. The most significant thing about the year 2011 was the time that I have spent with my mentor, team mate and a good friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jijesh-mohan/a/488/545">Jijesh Mohan</a>. I have started the year with full of ambitions but with the uncertainty of how to achieve them. Though I have worked really hard to achieve those ambitions, I failed plenty of times while trying to reach the next level and the reason is absence of direction. Jijesh shared his experience with me and helped a lot in understanding various aspects of programming, software development and much more. Hearty thanks Jijesh <img alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-n3NYjmGhjro/TvyccIdnG0I/AAAAAAAAANY/-8YxbNYlPjU/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none;" /> . The difference you made in my life as a programmer can not be expressed just by words.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div><div align="justify">It was a tough decision to make, but I have decided to leave Cognizant to explore different real time problems which are totally outside my comfort zone. I would like to thank my cherished manager&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ramakrishnan-venkatasubramanian/8/85/6a0">Ramakrishnan</a>, and beloved leads <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/pub/vijay-krishnan-ramaswamy/43/738/766">Vijay</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003088519900">Karthik</a>. Thank you all three for the inspiration, responsibilities and freedom you offered me to explore, learn, apply and adopt new technologies on various assignments. The trust you had in me helped a lot to shape up my professional career. I will surely miss you.<br /><br /></div><div align="justify"><strong>What’s Next ?</strong></div><div align="justify"><br />I will be joining <a href="http://www.advisory.com/">Advisory Board</a> in the first week on February 2012. I am very excited about it as it is a position that enable me to solve complex problems which involves huge volumes of data.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div><div align="justify"><strong>Goals </strong></div><div align="justify"><br />The one thing which keep me passionate and crazy about Computer Science is <strong>It is a path with no destination</strong>. One good lesson which I have learned last year is having goals like WaterFall model will not keep you valuable in the market. Like the requirements, the technologies are also volatile so the right way I believe is <strong>being Agile </strong>and the bottom line is set big goals, but make constant corrections along the way. My focus for the year 2012 would be</div><ul><li> <div align="justify">Javascript, HTML5, interactive Web Applications</div></li><li> <div align="justify">Functional Programming</div></li><li> <div align="justify">Working with huge volume of data</div></li><li> <div align="justify">Agile Methodologies</div></li><li> <div align="justify">Open Source Contributions</div></li><li> <div align="justify">Knowledge sharing through blogs and webinars</div></li></ul><div align="justify">Wish you all a very happy and prosperous new year.</div></div></div>
