    When I first started learning fsharp, one of the astounding fact that hit my mind was <em>"If the code compiles it usually works!"</em> For a guy who is coming from C# and Java Programming background it was bit weird! After delving deep into f# I have found it very useful and inspired by its awesomeness. In this blog-post I'll be covering some of my experiences that I come across while learning this great feature!

  <h3>Fever Diagnosis Program</h3>
  <p>
    Let us consider a simple fever diagnosis program. If your temperature is greater than 37.5 Celsius or 99.0 Fahrenheit then you are suffering from fever else you are all right.  
  </p>

  <h3>Defining Temperature Types</h3>
  <p>One of the cool feature that I like about f# is its less verbosity. You can do lot of magic things with less lines of code! Consider our fever diagnosis program, A temperature can be of type either Celsius or Fahrenheit. Here is the equivalent type defined in f#</p>

  {% codeblock lang:fsharp %}
type Temperature = 
  | Celsius of double
  | Fahrenheit of double  {% endcodeblock %}

  <p>Just 3 lines of code!</p>
  <p>The type Temperature has been defined as a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233226.aspx">discriminated union.</a> Discriminated unions represent data that can take on one of a few different types of results.</p> Also in this 3 lines we have described the strongly typed alias for temperature in both Celsius and in Fahrenheit. With this code in place if you want to describe a temperature in Celsius or in Fahrenheit all you need to use the following syntax

  {% codeblock lang:fsharp %}
let tempInCelsius = Celsius 10.8
let tempInFahernheit = Fahrenheit 10.6
  {% endcodeblock %}
