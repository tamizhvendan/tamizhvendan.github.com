To <br />avoid this overhead (Headache too!!) some developers may opt for MS Access. This <br />Access based solution will not work for you if you are going to develop large <br />database centric application.<br /><br /><br /><br />You may ask, I am going to leverage only minimal use of database in my <br />application, so what’s wrong in using access? Good Catch!! You can use access, <br />so that you can carry your database wherever you are deploying the application. <br />Hold on, by doing so you are losing a magic. Yes magic! The name of the magic is <br />Entity Framework. Using Entity Framework you can speak to your database with few <br />lines of coding and create application in minutes (even in seconds). Sounds <br />interesting! Do google "Entity Framework"!!.<br /><br /><br /><br />Fine,Thinking about the solution ?? The answer is SQL CE.<br /><br /><br />SQL CE is a free, embedded, database engine that enables easy database storage.It does not require you to install a database server in order to use it. You can carry the database in the same way as you did for access by simply copying the  SQL CE binaries to the \bin directory of your application.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Advantages of SQL CE</b><br /><br /><ul><li>No installation/security issues. </li><li>Works with existing Data APIs - ADO.NET,Entity Framework, etc.,</li><li>Suitable for light production scenarios</li><li>No License restrictions. Absolutely Free :-)</li><li>Can be migrated to SQL Server, SQL Express or SQL Azure easily</li></ul><br />You can download SQL CE from <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=206994">here.</a></div></div>
