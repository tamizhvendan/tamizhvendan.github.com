### Introduction

Fsharp is my new favorite language in recent times and I've been learning it for the last six months. I always believe the best way to learn a language / technology / framework is to create something using it and also learning from the mistakes while creating it. So, here is my attempt to create a sample web application in fsharp using ASP.NET MVC framework. In this series of blog posts I'm going to create "phone-cat" web application inspired from the [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat). 

As it is my maiden attempt to create a relatively large web application in fsharp, if you find something that can be improved, feel free to share *I'm willing to learn from you.*
